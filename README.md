# Airbnb

In this project, I utilized Tableau to conduct an extensive analysis of Airbnb data, focusing on key aspects such as pricing dynamics, booking patterns, host performance, and revenue insights. My goal was to uncover valuable insights that highlight Airbnb’s market trends and strategic positioning.


Data Visualization:
Created interactive Tableau dashboards to visualize:
- Neighborhood Pricing Dynamics: Patterns in how pricing varies across different neighborhoods.
- Booking Trends: Variations in booking patterns and availability across different regions.
- Host Performance: Metrics such as reviews, response rates, and occupancy rates for top hosts.
- Room Type Influence: Comparative analysis of pricing and demand based on room types (entire home, private room, shared room).
- Revenue Distribution: How revenue is distributed across different areas and its correlation with pricing.
- Guest Demographics: Trends and preferences based on guest demographics.
- Impact of Amenities: How various amenities affect listing attractiveness and pricing.
- Market Saturation: Levels of market saturation and competition in different regions.

Insights and Analysis:
Leveraged dynamic charts, heat maps, and trend lines to analyze:
- Pricing Variations: How neighborhood pricing impacts host performance and guest choices.
- Availability Patterns: Geographic trends in booking and availability, revealing high-demand and underexposed areas.
- Host Success Factors: Key factors contributing to the success of top-performing hosts.
- Room Type Pricing: Influence of room types on pricing strategies and guest preferences.
- Revenue Insights: Identification of revenue hotspots and patterns within the Airbnb market.

Interactive Dashboard:
Developed an interactive dashboard that allows users to:
- Explore Data in Real-Time: Filter and analyze various parameters for deeper insights.
- Gain Strategic Insights: Understand Airbnb’s market dynamics and performance metrics.
